# Bixi Bike Rental Data Analysis (2016)

Welcome to the Bixi Bike Rental Data Analysis project for the year 2016. In this project, I've delved into the rich dataset of Bixi bike rentals to gain insights into how and when people were renting bikes, popular rental locations, and various filtering options.

## Project Overview

Bixi is a popular bike-sharing service in Montreal, Canada, and this project aims to understand rider behavior and usage patterns through SQL data analysis.

### Key Highlights

Here's what you can find in this repository:

- **Data Exploration**: I've extensively explored the Bixi bike rental dataset from 2016. This includes understanding the structure of the data, data types, and initial observations.

- **Rental Trends**: By querying the dataset, I've identified when people were most active in renting bikes. This helps in understanding peak rental times and planning for bike availability.

- **Popular Locations**: Using SQL queries, I've determined popular rental locations within Montreal. These insights can assist in optimizing bike placement and marketing efforts.

- **Filtering Options**: I've explored various filtering options to allow users to customize their analysis based on criteria such as date range, location, and more.
